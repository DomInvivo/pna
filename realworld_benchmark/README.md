# Real-world benchmarks

![plots](./real-world.png)

## Overview

We provide the scripts for the download and execution of the real-world benchmarks we used. Most of the scripts in this directory were taken directly from or inspired by "Benchmarking GNNs" by Dwivedi _et al._ refer to their [code](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00982) for more details on their work.

- `configs` contains .json configuration files for the various datasets;
- `data` contains scripts to download the datasets;
- `nets` contains the architectures that were used with the PNA in the benchmarks;
- `train` contains the training scripts.
  
These benchmarks use the DGL version of PNA (`../models/dgl`)
