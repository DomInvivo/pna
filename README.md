# Directional GNN

## Overview

We provide the implementation of the Directional Graph Network (DGN) in PyTorch and DGL frameworks, along with scripts for running real-world benchmarks. The repository is organised as follows:

- `real_world` contains various scripts from [Benchmarking GNNs](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns) to download the real-world benchmarks and train the DGN on them. In `real_world/README.md` we provide instructions for the generation and training hyperparameters tuned.
